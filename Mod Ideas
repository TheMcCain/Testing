Not sure if anyone will ever read this, but if so, welcome to some of my mod ideas.

• 1968 Midnight - Reduxed version of Dan Bryan's 1968. Inspired by the Midnight aesthetic in 1964, and will have some minimal alternate history. (such as Nixon agreeing to debate) Probably will be based off and similar theme to 1968 DEANDEMOCRACY as I've done most of the coding for that mod
• Virginia Throwdown - You play as Glenn Youngkin after being elected to the Governorship. Starts out as an incumbency simulator, but you go on to finish your term either beloved or hated and challenge Mark Warner in the Senate. Heavily inspired by Green Mountain State.
• 2000 Redux Redux - My first mod! It was incredibly poorly made, and an update that makes it playable would be neat. To be honest, the topic is kinda boring though, so this probably will never happen.
• 2020 Four-Way - Incumbent Clinton vs Rubio, with Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders running third-party. Very inspired by 2016 Four Way and 2016 Four Way Redux.
• 2012 Jeb - After narrowly winning in 2004, incumbent John Kerry is defeated by Jeb in 2008. Also an incumbent simulator, will have a strong Windows 7 design, and have multiple challengers like Barack Obama or Killary Klinton.
• 2016 Republican Primaries - This would probably be too ambitious, but it would be super cool for sure. The 2016 Republican primaries were probably one of the most interesting primaries ever, even rivaling the 2016 and 2020 Democratic primaries in my opinion.
• The Deep State - Y'know that path in W. where you could face Killary Klinton with John McCain as her running mate for re-election? I think it'd be cool to make a mod where you play as Killary in 2004 and chose McCain as your running mate.
• 1840 - Historical mod. I've wanted to make it for a while, but I'm pretty sure Astro is already making it, so I probably won't make this one.
• 1844 Redux - Need I say more? Better version of Bryan's 1844. This election was and is fasinating and I think it would be great for a redux.
• Make America Great Again - I feel like it's kind of odd that there's no story-based mod for Trump's 2016 campaign, and I think it would be a great candidate for a story-based mod. Could even have some flashbacks or something.
• 2018 Texas Senate - This race was extremely close, and Cruz only narrowly won in the end. A mod for this could be great
• 2010 Florida Senate - This was a 3 way race between soon-to-be Senator Marco Rubio, Independent Governor Charlie Crist, and Representative Kendrick Meek. Think this would make a good and interesting mod.
• 2025 NYC Mayoral - This is currently a four-way race between Cuomo, Adams, Mamdani, and Sliwa. Election day is only a few weeks away and this race would be super interesting. All 4 candidates should be playable, you have the option to drop out as Adams or Sliwa, etc. Think this would be epic.
