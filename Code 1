As a term-limited Bill Clinton is on his way out of office, many are optimistic for what the future will hold.   </p><p>  With America remaining the world's sole superpower, many are confident that it's brightest days are still ahead of it. Only an unprecedented impeachment of the President and and his removal could destroy the unity and goodwill the country has built up over the last decade, but that probably won't happen. Still, some people are beginning to see through the President's calculated charm.   </p>",

With Bush's popularity collapsing and Perot siphoning off critical votes from him, he was able to win the election with relative ease. </p><p> Governing as a \"bipartisan\" moderate, he's built a coalition uniting coal workers in Appalachia and suburbanites in Westchester alike. With a strong economy, he was able to win re-election in 1996, and his approval rating has continued to rise steadily. Behind the scenes, however, he has skeletons in his closet he doesn't want Hillary, nor Congress, nor the public to know about. Most Americans like him, but he may have something to hide. </p>",
